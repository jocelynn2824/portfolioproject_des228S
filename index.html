        <h2>Hello!</h2>
  <p>Jocelyn Ochoa Perez is a senior Visual Communication Design major at San Francisco State University. As a first‑generation Mexican–Salvadoran American, she brings her pride and a diverse perspective to her creative work.</p>

  <p>She is passionate about design that emphasizes representation, accessibility, and clarity. Jocelyn advocates for visuals that not only look appealing but are also easy to understand and inclusive to audiences of all backgrounds.</p>

  <p>Although early in her career, she focuses on purpose‑driven design—working across layout, typography, and illustration. Her projects are grounded in storytelling and meaning, inspired by sources such as film, literature, live concerts, and everyday life.</p>

  <p>Jocelyn approaches each assignment with thoughtful intention, balancing aesthetic refinement with practical communication goals. She leverages her heritage and academic training to craft designs that embody cultural narratives while maintaining user‑centered functionality.</p>

  <p>She believes that effective design bridges differences and communicates ideas with elegance and empathy. By integrating inclusive choices, thoughtful color palettes, and accessible layouts, Jocelyn strives to ensure that her work resonates meaningfully with diverse audiences.</p>

  <p>Her goal is to collaborate with individuals and organizations that value simplicity, clarity, and cultural storytelling. She relishes opportunities to learn and grow, pushing her creative practice toward greater impact and resonance.</p>

  <p>In the future, Jocelyn hopes to develop branding, editorial, or interactive projects that highlight underrepresented voices and promote accessible design solutions. She seeks to use her visual storytelling skills to drive both beautifully crafted and socially conscious work.</p>

  <p>Jocelyn welcomes connection with peers, mentors, and clients who share her commitment to clarity, cultural identity, and inclusive design. She is eager to contribute to creative endeavors that embody purpose and integrity.</p>
